# Bloc - Keys to Success

## New Student Reflection

**My strengths will be:**

1. Making good use of my mentors
  * I was fortunate enough to work with several mentors throughout my undergrad, and I believe that it will come naturally to me to establish strong relationships with my various mentors throughout the Bloc program. In my option, the mentor-mentee relationship is a reciprocal one; I look forward to receiving feedback from my mentor, but also challenging them in new ways that will allow for mutual growth.
2. Embracing challenges
  * I gravitate towards situations that will challenge me to step outside of my comfort zone. I enjoy the reward of taking on a task that will push me to reflect or problem-solve in new and creative ways. I understand that there will be many challenges throughout Bloc, but that these are all part of the learning process.
3. Learning to forage
  * My learning style is very independent, and I enjoy doing research and being autonomous in finding solutions to the problems that I encounter. I strongly believe that the best way to learn is through exploring various solutions and testing the applications of those solutions.

**I will need to improve/work on:**

1. Time commitment 
  * Since I will be working full time throughout the duration of this program, I will need to make a concious effort to set aside time in my schedule to work on Bloc. I know that this commitment might mean that I have to make sacrifices in other areas such as my social life, but I will keep in mind that when I choose to sit down and work on Bloc, I am investing in myself and my goals of becoming a Designer. 
2. Actively participating on Slack
  * As I mentioned above, my learning style is very independent, and as a result, I sometimes struggle to ask others for help. Additionally, I struggle with perfectionism, which often leads me to feel self-concious about the work that I produce and thus hesitant to share with other people. I know that asking questions and advice from the Slack community will help me to make the most of this program, but it is definitely an area that I will need to focus on!
